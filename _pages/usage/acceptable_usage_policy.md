summary: An overview of the DoS API Acceptable Usage Policy
---

The Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”) describes actions that NHS Digital prohibits when any party uses the Directory of Services APIs (referred to as "DoS APIs" or "the Services").

This AUP has examples of restricted behaviour, but does not list all restricted behaviours.

Ultimately, NHS Digital will decide whether your use violates the AUP. We may modify this Policy from time to time. By using the Services, you agree to the latest version of this Policy. If you violate the Policy or authorise or help others to do so, we may suspend or terminate your use of the Services.

We issue an Acceptable Usage Policy (AUP) to all new consumers of the DoS APIs. On the most part these are a standard set of guidelines for API usage, however we may tailor the AUPs to individual API consumers based on the intended use cases.

While we’ve done our best to make our AUP complete, readable, and understandable, you may still have additional questions. We get that. So, feel free to contact our support team at dos.enquiries@nhs.net.

# The Policy

## Be responsible when displaying information publicly
Not all service information is appropriate for displaying directly to the public - many services are only available via professional referral routes and are not appropriate for self-referral by a member of the public. The information you display to the public could influence decision-making which could introduce an amount of clinical responsibility on your part.

If you are planning to present DoS information directly to the public you should:

- Discuss your use case with the NHS Digital team and gain explicit permission to display information publicly
- Make contact with both the NHS England DoS Team and your local DoS Team to discuss your use case
- Gain explicit permission from the DoS Lead(s) responsible for the information you wish to use
- Ensure you have a valid Clinical Safety Case / Hazard Assessment for your product (SCCI0129)

## Keep data fresh
You should avoid caching DoS information - wherever possible, retrieve the most recent information that is available at the point it is required.

If you do have a need to keep a local copy of DoS information you should attempt to minimise the length of time for which you are relying on it. Retrieve a fresh version of the data at the earliest opportunity.

If you believe you have a use case which warrants programatic caching of DoS information you must discuss this with the DoS team and gain explicit permission for that usage pattern. 

## Don't crawl the API
You are not allowed to systematically crawl the API. Any activity resembling crawling activity will be monitored, investigated, and could lead to your API access being suspected or revoked.

## Monitoring and enforcement
We reserve the right, but do not assume the obligation, to investigate any violation of this Policy or misuse of the Services or Website.

We may report any activity that we suspect violates any law or regulation to appropriate law enforcement officials, regulators, or other appropriate third parties. Our reporting may include disclosing appropriate customer information. We also may cooperate with appropriate law enforcement agencies, regulators, or other appropriate third parties to help with the investigation and prosecution of illegal conduct by providing network and systems information related to alleged violations of this Policy.
